# Foodie-game-project-repo

A fun and interactive browser-based quiz game that tests your knowledge across five food categories: Junk Food, Seafood, Arabic Food, Italian Food, and Chinese Food.


## 📋 Project Description

**Foodie-game** is a web-based quiz game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game consists of **25 questions** for one mixed category and 10 for each specific category depending on the user's choice , with **total of approximately 150 questions in the dataset**. Users will be going through each food category and answer multiple-choice questions to test their knowledge. It can be T/F, fill in the blanks or a regular MCQ question.

Each correct answer will be calculated, and at the end of the quiz, the total score is shown and will be decided whether you are a true foodie or not based on the number of questions you answered correctly and there is a different criteria and message at the end depending on how well the user has done. So a win lose scenario.
## Why Chosen this game?
I like food, simply xD. And i always like the quiz-based web browser games where you learn new things, new cultures and it encourages you to try new dishes. For example, if i see a question about special type of seafood, then i might get curious to try it out.
